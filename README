I wrote this utility as an exercise in working with and issuing cookies from the client side.
The utility provides three methods for working with cookies.

Create Cookie
boolean Cookie.set(str name, str value[, obj opts])

arguments:
  name - the name of the cookie specified as a string
  value - the value the named cookie will store as a string
  opts - an object that allows for addition settings:
    expires - date object specifying when the cookie expires
    path - the url path the cookie can be accessed from
    domain - domain on which the cookie can be accessed from
    secure - if the cookie is being set over a secure connection
  
a boolean value is returned based on whether or not the cookie was successfully created


Retrieve cookie value
mixed Cookie.get(str name)

arguments:
  name - the name of the cookie to retrieve the value for, specified as a string

if a cookie with the specified name cannot be found, false is returned
otherwise the value of the cookie is returned as a string


Delete cookie
str Cookie.remove(str name[, obj opts])

arguments:
  name - the name of the cookie to delete, specified as a string
  opts - an object that allows for the specification of additional settings, as setting should match the
         options that are specified when the cookie was created
    path - the url path from which the cookie is accessed from
	domain - the domain from which the cookie is accessed from
	

See the included index.html file additional examples of usage.
